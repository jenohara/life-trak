Welcome To the LifeTrak app. The main purpose of this app is to allow users to create multiple journals, one for each area of interest, they can then create multiple entries for each journal. Each entry is associated with multiple moods, and by clicking on the moods tab and a specific mood, they will see all the entries they have made for that mood. Each user can only see Journals and Entries made by themself, but the moods are visible to everyone. However, when filtering by mood, they can only see their own entries.
